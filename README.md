# About
HCL is an **Interpreted, Object Oriented** language written in Java. It is also **dynamically typed** and has a 
very **modern syntax** inspired from Java and Python. This interpreter is inspired from [jLox of Crafting 
Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

# Requirements
- Java JDK (latest version is more preferable)

# Installation
To Install the interpreter, head over to the [releases](https://github.com/harishtpj/HCL/releases) page and 
download the latest release of HCL interpreter. The zip/tarball file will be named as `hcl-<latest_version>`.
Unzip the release and store it in your desired directory.

Then Add the `/bin` directory to your PATH environment variable.


#### For windows users

1. Copy the `\bin` location of HCL installed folder to clipboard
2. The first step depends which version of Windows you're using:
  * If you're using Windows 8 or 10, press the Windows key, then search for and
    select "System (Control Panel)".
  * If you're using Windows 7, right click the "Computer" icon on the desktop
    and click "Properties".
3. Click "Advanced system settings".
4. Click "Environment Variables".
5. Under "System Variables", find the `PATH` variable, select it, and click
   "Edit". If there is no `PATH` variable, click "New".
6. Add the copied directory location to the beginning of the variable value followed by `;` (a
   semicolon). For example, if the value was `C:\Windows\System32`, change it to
   `C:\Users\Me\HCL\bin;C:\Windows\System32`.
7. Click "OK".
8. Restart your terminal.
9. Verify that the path is set by opening a new command window and run `hcl -v`.

#### For Mac users:

1. Copy the `\bin` location of HCL installed folder to clipboard
2. Open the `.bash_profile` file in your home directory (for example,
   `/Users/your-user-name/.bash_profile`) in a text editor.
3. Add `export PATH="<copied-hcl-bin-path>:$PATH"` to the last line of the file, where
   *<copied-hcl-bin-path>* is the copied directory location of HCL.
4. Save the `.bash_profile` file.
5. Restart your terminal.
6. Verify that the path is set by opening a new terminal and run `hcl -v`.

#### For Linux users:

1. Copy the `\bin` location of HCL installed folder to clipboard
1. Open the `.bashrc` file in your home directory (for example,
   `/home/your-user-name/.bashrc`) in a text editor.
2. Add `export PATH="<copied-hcl-bin-path>:$PATH"` to the last line of the file, where
   *<copied-hcl-bin-path>* is the copied directory location of HCL.
3. Save the `.bashrc` file.
4. Restart your terminal.
5. Verify that the path is set by opening a new terminal and run `hcl -v`.

# Usage
To run your first program, fire up you favourite text editor and copy the following lines to `hello.hcl` file:
```hcl
# A Simple Hello, World! program

println "Hello, world!";
println "HCL is interesting!";
```

Then open a new terminal in the same directory as the file and run:
```bash
$ hcl hello.hcl
```

For windows users: just run the same command.

You'll see the following output on your terminal:

```
Hello, world!
HCL is interesting!
```
